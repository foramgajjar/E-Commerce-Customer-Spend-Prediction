# E-Commerce-Customer-Spend-Prediction

This project utilizes Linear Regression to predict the yearly amount spent by e-commerce customers based on their behavioral data and membership details.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains customer information, including:

**Avg. Session Length**: Average duration of a customer session.

**Time on App**: Time spent on the e-commerce mobile app.

**Time on Website**: Time spent on the website.

**Length of Membership**: Duration of customer membership.

**Yearly Amount Spent**: Total amount spent by the customer in a year (Target Variable).

**Installation**
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Data Overview:**

Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.

**Checking for missing values.**

Getting summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).

**Feature Correlations:**

Generating a heatmap to visualize correlations between features.

Identifying the most influential variables for predicting customer spending.

**Pairplot Analysis:**

Creating scatterplots to observe relationships between variables.

Understanding the impact of individual features on yearly spending.

**Distribution of Variables:**

Plotting histograms to analyze the distribution of numerical variables.

Checking for outliers that may affect model performance.

**Results**

The Linear Regression model predicts customer spending based on key features, with Length of Membership being the most influential factor.
